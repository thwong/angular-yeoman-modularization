      <h3>Why a new template?</h3>
      <p>
        While there are many angular based templates out there, not many of them are optimized for building large scale web applications that contain and share a large set of components.  The angular generator created and maintained by the yeoman team is one of the best templates out there; however, even so, it does not contain built-in supports for capabilities such as lazy-loading, i18n supports, code coverage integrations, etc. which are keys for building and maintain large scale applications.  This is the reason why I introudce this new template that contains all the building blocks weird in and ready for use.
      </p>
      <h3>Using yeoman generator as base.</h3>
      <p>
        The basic structure of this template is generated using the <a href="https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular" target="_blank">Yeoman Angular Generator</a>.  Therefore, you can utilize the nice generator functions to creating new controllers, services, directives, etc.
        Here are some examples:
      </p>
      <p>Here are some examples: (You can view the complete list on the Yeoman website)</p>
        <pre>
<code>
> yo angular:controller Main           // Create a new controller
> yo angular:directive FileUpload      // Create a new directive
> yo angular:factory User              // Create a new factory
</code>
        </pre>

      <h3>Using Coffeescript as main programming language</h3>
      <p>
        This template uses <a href="http://coffeescript.org/" target="_blank">Coffeescipt</a> as the main programming language which will be compiled into Javascript by the grunt watcher.  There are multiple main benefits of using coffeescript:
        <ul>
          <li>The grunt coffeescript watcher compiles the code on demand, which helps developers to catch code errors early</li>
          <li>The coffeescript syntax is concise and less-verbose, which helps developers to focus on the core business logic</li>
          <li>The complied Javascript codes are robust and following many Javascript best practices</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h3>Using LESS as the main styling language</h3>
      <p>
        This template uses <a href="http://lesscss.org/" target="_blank">LESS</a> as the main styling language which will be complited into CSS by the grunt watcher, and the organization of the LESS files follow the <a href="https://smacss.com/" target="_blank">SMACSS</a> pattern.  There are multiple main benefits of using LESS:
        <ul>
          <li>The grunt less watcher compiles the LESS code on demand, which helps developers to view the style change instantly</li>
          <li>The SMACSS guide file structure helps developers to maintain CSS class dependency and modularization</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h3>Using grunt and bower for build</h3>
      <p>
        This template uses <a href="http://gruntjs.com/" target="_blank">Grunt</a> as the build system that handles the compilation of files, packaging of contents, CSS and image optimization, test runners, etc.  The dependency of external plugins are done using <a href="http://bower.io/" target="_blank">bower</a>.
      </p>

      <h3>Modulizing codes wiht UI router and ocLazyLoader</h3>
      <p>
        To maintain efficent loading time of all pages, this template uses the <a href="https://oclazyload.readme.io/" target="_blank">ocLazyLoader</a> with the <a href="https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router" target="_blank">Angular UI-Router</a> to load in only files that are required for any particular route.  This solves one of the main problems that one faces when using the original yeoman generator - that is all the files and dependencies are loaded up front.  When the application grows, the amount of code loaded in up front is extremely large.
      </p>

      <h3>Providing i18n capabilities via getText</h3>
      <p>
        To make i18n as painless and as easy as possible, this template uses the <a href="https://angular-gettext.rocketeer.be/" target="_blank">getText</a> component.  There are couple main benefits of using getText:
        <ul>
          <li>Easy to get started. Developer can start with the English version of the application without worrying about any translation at all.</li>
          <li>With the translate directive, it is very easy for developer to annoate all strings that need to be translated.</li>
          <li>Translate of new or exisitng strings made extremely simple with the <a href="http://poedit.net/" target="_blank">Poedit</a> editor</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
